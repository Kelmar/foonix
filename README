Information goes here I think....

Lots of stuff is still broken with everything including the build.

Some general help though:

To get third party tools for a cross compile do:
make fetch

These tools still must be built by hand; good luck.

Some stuff that's done:
* Global descriptor tables (although simple) are working.
* Interrupts are handled.
* Code for handling delays using the PIT is working.

Some TODOs:
* Makefiles need some serious work.
* Architecture specific code needs to be seperated out.
* Some functions need to be moved into a common library.
* Finish ATA driver.
* Build a file system.
* Add basic POSIX hooks for getting newlib/glibc to compile/run.
* Make a real driver model.
* Fix broken paging support, get a working memory manager.
* Everything else that isn't done yet.
* C++ support?  Maybe?
